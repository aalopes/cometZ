= Description =

CometZ is a simple side scrolling space shooter whose objective is to destroy 
enemies ships while avoiding that our ship's shield is reduced to 0.
It features several kinds of enemy ships and health power ups to replenish
shield.

This software makes use of the PyGame Python library.

Source use Windows EOL at the moment, since Unix systems are a bit more
tolerant than Windows.

    python cometz.py
